# dotfiles
Easily configurable install scripts for bash.

I recommend setting up a startup job that runs autostart_apps when starting
your machine so that the settings in bashrc can take effect every time you log in.

The CAPS LOCK key gets rebound in bashrc to an opening curly brace, Since caps lock is utterly useless.

Also some nice aliases and some of my own programs.

Run the command below to configure your machine. (Symlinks dotfiles in this repo with dotfiles on the machine)
```sh
./install.sh
